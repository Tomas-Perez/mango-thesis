To our families, who gave us their unconditional support and made this possible.

To our friends: Marcelo, Pipo, Gaston, Mart√≠n, Ricardo, Romi and Augusto, who kept us sane during dark times.

And to our tutors, Giovanni Agosta and Giuseppe Massari, who guided us and were never too busy to answer our questions.
